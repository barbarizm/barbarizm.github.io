	<h2>What is this Site?</h2>
	<p>
	 Its a public journal, or place where I dump whatever is stuck in my mind.
	 Simply the possibility, however slim, that a person could read this, changes the way I write it.
	 I've found that I journal more often if I make it "public" (I am not SEO-optimizing this site, even though that would be funny).
	</p>
	<h2>Why is this Site?</h2>
	<p>
	 I need a way to let go of some, well alot, of shit.
	 And I do mean need; I have to get these thoughts, ideas, words out somewhere, anywhere or I think they will drag me back down.
	 And I can't go back to that all-consuming void; I would die before that.
	 And I don't want to die, so here I am.
	 As you can see, some of it is going to be rather heavy and angsty, so you know, be warned.
