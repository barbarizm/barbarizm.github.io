	<h2>What is this Site?</h2>
	<p>
	  Its a public journal, or place where I dump whatever is stuck in my mind.
	  I've found that I journal more often and more clearly if I make it "public".
	  Simply the possibility, however slim, that a person could read this, changes the way I write it.
	</p>
	<h2>Why is this Site?</h2>
	<p>
	  I need a way to let go of some, well alot, of shit.
	  And I do mean need; I have to get these thoughts, ideas, words out somewhere, anywhere or I think they will drag me back down.
	  And I can't go back to that all-consuming void; I would die before that.
	  And I don't want to die, so here I am.
	  As you can see, some of it is going to be rather heavy and angsty, so you know, be warned.

	<h3>I have Complex-Post-Traumatic-Stress Disorder</h3>
	<p>
	  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20556323-complex-ptsd">Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving</a> is the seminal text on CPTSD, at least to my knowledge.

	<h3>I wonder what love feels like</h3>
	<p>
	  Is it warm like dawn sunlight, or does it embrace you like a comfy chair?
	  Does it tickle like a rough kitten's tongue?
	  Does it sparkle and glint like a pond gently kissed by a summer breeze?
	  Is it fortifying like a cold shower in the morning?

	<h3>Why wasn't enough for anyone?</h3>
	<p>
	  I've always been alone, the main reason being I was dead, empty husk of a barely alive human being.
	  But that isn't the only reason, or at least, I hate it if it is the only reason.

	  I can look back and see how people kinda tried to approach me.
	  But it was clear they were not approaching me as I was or close to how I was.
	  They were approaching who they thought I was, apparently a confident, if quiet, attractive man.
	  But that wasn't me; I was a scarred, drowning, empty husk of a human being.

	<h3>Why did you give me a ham sandwich when I was bleeding out?</h3>
	<p>
	  I wasn't hungry, I needed something to stop the bleeding.
	  I needed to be rushed to a hospital, I needed you to hold my hand when they rushed me to the operating room.
	  Did you not see I was dying, or did you just not care?
	  I gave you what I could, as little as it was.
	  Why could you not give a single piece from your overflowing abundance?

	<h3>Why did I have to be seen That Way?</h3>
	<p>
	  People have always treated me weirdly.
	  They are nice, but distant.
	  They say I am unapproachable, but they never tried.
	  They act like I am going to

	<h3>I never expected to get to this point, and its really fucking with me</h3>
	<p>
	  I feel like a prisoner whose spent 20 years on death row, who suddenly get released.
	  I had resigned myself to my fate; I was marked for death, that was that.
