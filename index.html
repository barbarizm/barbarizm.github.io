	<h2>What is this Site?</h2>
	<p>
	  Its a public journal, or place where I dump whatever is stuck in my mind.
	  Simply the possibility, however slim, that a person could read this, changes the way I write it.
	  I've found that I journal more often if I make it "public" (I am not SEO-optimizing this site, even though that would be funny).
	</p>
	<h2>Why is this Site?</h2>
	<p>
	  I need a way to let go of some, well alot, of shit.
	  And I do mean need; I have to get these thoughts, ideas, words out somewhere, anywhere or I think they will drag me back down.
	  And I can't go back to that all-consuming void; I would die before that.
	  And I don't want to die, so here I am.
	  As you can see, some of it is going to be rather heavy and angsty, so you know, be warned.

	<h3>I have Complex-Post-Traumatic-Stress Disorder</h3>
	<p>
	  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20556323-complex-ptsd">Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving</a> is the seminal text on CPTSD, at least to my knowledge.

	<h3>I wonder what love feels like</h3>
	<p>
	  Is it warm like dawn sunlight, or does it embrace you like a comfy chair?
	  Does it tickle like a rough kitten's tongue?
	  Does it sparkle and glint like a pond gently kissed by a summer breeze?
	  Is it fortifying like a cold shower in the morning?
	  Is it sickly sweet like the 100th piece of candy you ate on Halloween?
	  Does it shift and flow like the branches of a willow in a storm?

	<h3>I wonder if I will ever love someone</h3>
	<p>
	  I know I've never loved someone before, I was far too destroyed for that.
	  I've always worried that having to struggle alone to get to my normal would jade me on people.
	  Would I be able to look past my disdain for the faceless, nameless humanity that abandoned me.
	  The humanity that demanded that I heal myself, that I make myself whole before I would be allowed to
	  Sure, the actual person in front had no way of helping me in the past, but I doubt they would have even if they did have the chance.

	<h3>Why wasn't enough for anyone?</h3>
	<p>
	  I've always been alone, the main reason being I was dead, empty husk of a barely alive human being.
	  But that isn't the only reason, or at least, I hate it if it is the only reason.

	</p>
	<p>
	  I can look back and see how people kinda tried to approach me.
	  But it was clear they were not approaching me as I was or close to how I was.
	  They were approaching who they thought I was, apparently a confident, if quiet, attractive man.
	  But that wasn't me; I was a scarred, drowning, empty husk of a human being.

	<h3>Why did you give me a ham sandwich when I was bleeding out?</h3>
	<p>
	  I wasn't hungry, I needed something to stop the bleeding.
	  I needed to be rushed to a hospital, I needed you to hold my hand when they rushed me to the operating room.
	  Did you not see I was dying, or did you just not care?
	  I gave you what I could, as little as it was.
	  Why could you not give a single piece from your overflowing abundance?
	</p>

	<h3>Why did I have to be seen That Way?</h3>
	<p>
	  People have always treated me weirdly.
	  They are nice, but distant.
	  They say I am unapproachable, but they never tried.
	  They act like I am going to bite their head off if they ask me a single question.

	<h3>I never expected to get to this point, and its really fucking with me</h3>
	<p>
	  I feel like a prisoner whose spent 20 years on death row, who suddenly get released.
	  I had resigned myself to my fate; I was marked for death, that was that.
	  I would never taste any number of pleasures, I had accepted my loss.
	</p>

	<h3>Why did I need to put all the effort into starting a relationship?</h3>
	<p>
	  I was really fucked up, like really really fucked-up.
	  If you were also a broken husk of a human being, I offer no judgment whatsoever; we understand each other.
	  My anger is targeted at you, the okay people.
	  The people whose worst thing in their life was not having friends for 3 weeks, you fuckers.
	  The fuck do you expect me to break my back to get a sliver of your attention?
	  While you live in an opulence I have no comprehension of?
	  Fuck you, and your expectations!

	<h3>I have no where to rest anymore</h3>
	<p>
	  I used to be able to drown myself in TV and movies.
	  I used to be able to recover some energy alone, locked in my room.
	  But I can't do that anymore.
	  I need to connect with people, but I don't where to meet them.
	  I need to see a smile grow on the face of someone I care about.
