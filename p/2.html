	<h1>I've lost my direction</h1>
	<p>
	  I always knew	what direction I needed to move, out of wherever I was at.
	  I needed to get to my "normal".
	  And I think I did it; I am undeniably leagues better then I have ever been before.
	  But now I am just in a very new mental state that I don't know what to do with.
	  Maybe its that I lost	my main motivator, fear/pain.
	  Its true I don't have any idea what ordering my life around things I enjoy and want is like.
	  Definitely a big part of it, but it doesn't feel complete.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I am kinda forgetting, but its not exactly forgetting, my past self and more exactly, what it felt like being him.
	  Maybe disconnected is better?
	  I am kinda gas-lighting myself about the things that happened.
	  Part of it is that I have gained a very different perspective, i.e. my normal's perspective.
